The objective of this project is to define a distribution for the infinitely
sparse matrices, incorporating distance information. Though Frazier and Blei
have defined the distance dependent Indian buffet process (dd-IBP), the 
distribution we are proposing will incorporate a measure of attraction similar
to in the EPA distribution. We will also develop a method to sample from the
distribution and make posterior inference. \\

\noindent
The p.m.f for $\bm Z$ in the ddIBP involves the enumeration of all possible sets
of connectivity matrices and ownership vectors that generates the same $\bm Z$ 
matrix. This becomes infeasible very quickly as the dimensions of $\bm Z$ 
increases. Evaluating the p.m.f, therefore, cannot be done except for smaller
dimensions of $\bm Z$, and typical metropolis-hastings algorithms based just on 
the likelihood and prior, cannot be conveniently implemented.\\

\noindent
The new distribution we will propose will incorporate attraction information to
determine how customers are connected by dishes. It will also preserve properties 
of the original IBP, such as expected number of dishes drawn by each customer,
expected number of dishes drawn in total, and expected sum of the $\bm Z$ matrix.

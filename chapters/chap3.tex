The objective of this project is to define a distribution for the infinitely
sparse matrices, incorporating distance information. Though Frazier and Blei
have defined the distance dependent Indian buffet process (dd-IBP), the 
distribution we are proposing will incorporate a measure of attraction similar
to in the EPA distribution. We will also deveop a method to sample from the
distribution and make posterior inference. \\

% What are the applications of such a distribution?
% What are the values of having such a distrubition?

%The value of having such a distribution is that we can model

I would like to first of all thank Dr. David B. Dahl, my research adviser. The nature of research in Statistics is that researchers want to find answers to unsolved problems. So, I am grateful for a mentor that encourages me to search, think, and study on my own when I cannot find an answer elsewhere.  I also express gratitude to the department faculty who have taught me at Brigham Young University. Their enthusiasm for the subject of Statistics and my success have often inspired me to press on with hope when I am discouraged by my research and performance in class. They have taught me a great deal and given me an opportunity to see meaningful applications of Statistics. This instills, in me, aspirations to contribute to my community thru the subject. Finally, I express gratitude to my father and mother, who have always been supportive of me and all my fields of studies, including music. They have never tried to persuade me to study something I did not enjoy. Because of their unconditional love and support, I believe I have been able to enjoy a fulfilling and balanced life thus far.
